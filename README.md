# Modnikky online store

## Overview

My first SPA on Vue.js as an introduction to this JavaScript framework. Modnikky is an online store of women clothes with PLP, PDP, bag, wish-list and authentication pages. This project created using a build setup based on [Vite](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) that allowed me to use Vue Single-File Components. As a state manager I used [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) because of proper TypeScript support. Also I used [Vue-lazyload](https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-lazyload) for lazyloading images in my application and [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper) for implementation of most modern mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior to my application. I performed the authorization myself using localStorage Web API and Cookie.

_UPD: API isn't working._

## Summary

I tried to build a good application architecture, but in the end I ran into a few points that I hadn't fully thought through as logic processing - is there more logic in the components, in the store, or is it taken out separately in utilities? In the end I used a mixture of Options and Composition API to get familiar with the two approaches. Next I would prefer to use Composition API because better logic reuse, more flexible code organization, better type inference, smaller production bundle and less overhead.
